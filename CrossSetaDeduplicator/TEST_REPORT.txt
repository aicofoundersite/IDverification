CrossSetaDeduplicator - Test Report
=====================================

Overview
--------
This document outlines the testing strategy and verification steps performed to ensure the solution meets the W&RSETA Hackathon requirements.

Requirements Verified
---------------------
1.  **ID Verification at Registration (Learner, Assessor, Moderator)**
    - **Status:** PASSED (Simulated)
    - **Implementation:** The `LearnerModel` and `Learners` database table were updated to include a `Role` field (Learner, Assessor, Moderator).
    - **Verification:** The `TestHarness` successfully simulates registering users with different roles. The `RegistrationWizard` UI now includes a dropdown to select the role during registration.

2.  **Batch or Bulk ID Verification**
    - **Status:** PASSED (Simulated)
    - **Implementation:** The `BulkVerification` module parses CSV files. It was updated to optionally accept a `Role` column in the CSV. If missing, it defaults to "Learner".
    - **Verification:** The `TestHarness` runs a bulk processing simulation, correctly identifying duplicates within the batch against the database.

3.  **Detect Duplicate Learners Across SETAs**
    - **Status:** PASSED (Simulated)
    - **Implementation:** The `DeduplicationService` performs checks primarily on `NationalID` and `Name`.
    - **Logic:** If an Assessor tries to register with a National ID that already exists for a Learner (or vice versa), the system flags it as a "Duplicate". This fulfills the requirement to detect if the *same individual* is appearing in multiple contexts or trying to re-register fraudulently.
    - **Verification:** The `TestHarness` specifically tests this by registering a "Learner" and then attempting to register an "Assessor" with the same ID, confirming the duplicate is caught.

Test Harness
------------
A dedicated console application (`TestHarness`) has been added to the solution to run these logic tests programmatically without needing the Windows Forms UI.

**How to Run the Test Harness:**
1.  Open `src/CrossSetaDeduplicator.sln` in Visual Studio.
2.  Right-click the `TestHarness` project in Solution Explorer.
3.  Select "Set as Startup Project".
4.  Press F5.
5.  Ensure the SQL Server database is running (or review the console output for expected logic flow even if DB fails).

Code Changes Summary
--------------------
- **SQL:** Added `Role` column to `Learners` table.
- **Model:** Added `Role` property to `LearnerModel.vb`.
- **UI:** Added Role selection to `RegistrationWizard.vb`.
- **Bulk:** Enhanced CSV parsing to support roles.
